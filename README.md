#Mutilation Rites Band Website

This is the repository for my band's webpage.  I'll be using heroku to deploy and eventually migrating the old site to point to my heroku deployed app.
Since the page is static, there is no need for much customization, so I've opted to just use `create-react-app` to keep things simple.
